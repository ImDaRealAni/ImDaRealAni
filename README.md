## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm ImDaRealAni (AKA simply 'Ani'). I'm an aspiring engineer from Minnesota with a strong interest in aerospace and programming. 

### Past Interests

- In the past, I worked on various web development projects, mostly favoring use of the [Symfony PHP framework](https://github.com/symfony/symfony).
- I also worked extensively on Minecraft third-party server development in the past, including [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP), [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper), and [Dragonfly](https://github.com/df-mc/dragonfly) (in which I was given [a shout-out as a project contributor](https://github.com/df-mc/dragonfly/blob/master/server/session/enchantment_texts.go#L7)).

### Current and Potential Future Interests
- My current interests lie in developing Windows software applications with the C++/Win32 API, specifically in understanding low-level architecture and occasionally writing programs that attempt to misuse/abuse Windows internals (strictly for educational purposes only).
- As a corollary to the above, I maintain an interest in cybersecurity and malware.
- A future interest of mine is to program applications that I can incorporate into my engineering workflows when needed.
- I want to learn how to use [Unreal Engine](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine) in some capacity, whether it involves making large games, creating simple simulations, or something completely different.
- Lastly, I am just looking to discover and contribute to more open source projects!
